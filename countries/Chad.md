# Chad — EdTech Suitability & Compliance Profile  
A structured, source-based overview to assess how well EdTech tools align with Chad’s education system, regulatory environment, digital policies, and real-world delivery conditions.

## 1. Education System Overview (Context Setting)

Chad’s education system is centrally managed by the **Ministry of National Education and Civic Promotion (MENPC)**. It comprises preschool (2 years), primary (6 years), lower secondary (4 years), and upper secondary (3 years), followed by higher education. The system faces challenges of access, quality, and teacher shortages, particularly in rural areas. Education reform efforts have focused on improving literacy and expanding access, with support from donors such as the World Bank and UNESCO.

## 2. EdTech Implementation Landscape (Current State)

Digital learning adoption in Chad remains limited due to low connectivity, limited electricity access, and device scarcity. Most EdTech activity occurs through donor-supported initiatives such as **UNICEF’s Giga** (school connectivity mapping) and **World Bank’s Education Sector Reform Project (2019–2025)**, which includes ICT components. There is no national digital learning platform; pilots are fragmented, often using radio and mobile-based learning for foundational literacy and numeracy.

## 3. Core Pedagogy

**Key country insight:**  
Teaching in Chad is highly centralized, textbook-based, and exam-oriented, with limited room for local curriculum adaptation. Instructional methods are predominantly traditional, emphasizing rote learning and teacher-led delivery.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Tools must align tightly with national curricula and textbooks.  
- Adaptive or open-ended learning tools should include structured, teacher-guided modes.  
- Use of non-approved content in public schools requires ministry validation.  
- Local teacher facilitation materials are essential due to limited teacher digital capacity.

## 4. Focus Skills

**Key country insight:**  
Government and donor strategies emphasize foundational literacy, numeracy, and basic life skills, particularly for early grades and girls’ education. Digital skills are emerging priorities but not yet systematically integrated.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Priority for solutions supporting literacy, numeracy, and remedial learning.  
- Digital skills or coding tools are less likely to receive government focus funding.  
- Life skills and civic education modules can align with MENPC’s civic promotion mandate.

---

## 5. Content & Curriculum Alignment

**Key country insight:**  
The curriculum is nationally standardized, with French as the main language of instruction, though Arabic and local languages are used in some regions. The MENPC oversees all approved educational content.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Content must correspond to MENPC curriculum frameworks.  
- Localization into French (and potentially Arabic) is mandatory.  
- Use of foreign curricular content requires ministry review and adaptation.  
- Curriculum mapping to official grade levels is essential.

## 6. Teacher Professional Development

**Key country insight:**  
Teacher training is limited and uneven. ICT competencies are not yet part of standard teacher training. Donor programs (e.g., UNESCO, GPE) support small-scale ICT capacity building.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Include built-in teacher training and offline guides.  
- Cascade or blended training models are needed due to limited internet access.  
- No formal national accreditation system for EdTech training providers.

## 7. Assessment Approach

**Key country insight:**  
Assessment remains summative and exam-based, with national exams at primary and secondary levels. There is limited use of formative or digital assessment tools.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Solutions must align with exam content or help prepare students for standardized tests.  
- Formative assessment tools should integrate with teacher-led grading, not replace it.  
- No formal digital credentialing system exists.

## 8. Data Governance & Privacy

**Key country insight:**  
Chad does not have a dedicated data protection law or authority. General privacy is covered under the **Law No. 006/PR/2015 on Cybersecurity and Cybercrime**, but it lacks specific provisions for educational or child data.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- No explicit data localization requirement identified.  
- Providers should adopt international best practices (GDPR-like standards).  
- Obtain explicit consent from schools or parents for data use.  
- Avoid storing sensitive data on unsecured or foreign servers without safeguards.

---

## 9. Technical Interoperability

**Key country insight:**  
No national learning management system (LMS) or interoperability standards exist. The Ministry’s data systems are primarily administrative (EMIS), not instructional.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Integration requirements are minimal but interoperability is beneficial for donor projects.  
- Use open standards (SCORM, xAPI) for future compatibility.  
- Prepare for standalone or hybrid offline deployments.

**Sources:**  
- No formal interoperability policy identified.  

---

## 10. Cybersecurity & Child Online Safety

**Key country insight:**  
The 2015 Cybersecurity Law criminalizes cybercrime but does not define child-specific online safety measures. There are no national frameworks for child digital protection.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Implement internal child protection policies and content moderation.  
- Avoid exposure to unsafe third-party platforms.  
- Encrypt user data and follow international child protection standards (UNICEF guidance).

## 11. Delivery Constraints & Design Preferences

**Key country insight:**  
Connectivity and electricity access are extremely limited, especially in rural areas. Only about 10% of schools have reliable electricity. Mobile penetration is higher than broadband.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Offline-first or low-bandwidth designs are essential.  
- Mobile-accessible or radio-based solutions are preferred.  
- Local language audio or visual components improve accessibility.  
- Avoid heavy data or video streaming requirements.

## 12. Notes & Gaps

- **Strict requirements:** Curriculum alignment and language (French) approval by MENPC.  
- **Emerging expectations:** Teacher training integration, digital literacy support.  
- **Unclear areas:** Data protection obligations, interoperability standards, EdTech accreditation.  
- **Gaps:** No child data privacy law; no national digital education policy.  
- **Practical implications:** High need for offline functionality; localization cost high; approvals slow.  
- **Vendors:** Should plan for donor partnerships and hybrid delivery (radio, mobile, print).
