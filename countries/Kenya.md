# Kenya — EdTech Suitability & Compliance Profile  
A structured, source-based overview to assess how well EdTech tools align with Kenya’s education system, regulatory environment, digital policies, and real-world delivery conditions.

---

## 1. Education System Overview (Context Setting)

Kenya’s education system is centrally governed by the [Ministry of Education (MoE)](https://www.education.go.ke/), with oversight from semi-autonomous agencies such as the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD) and the Teachers Service Commission (TSC). The country is implementing the **Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC)**, transitioning from the 8-4-4 structure to a **2-6-3-3-3** system (2 years pre-primary, 6 years primary, 3 years junior secondary, 3 years senior secondary, and tertiary). Education policy emphasises inclusivity, digital literacy, and alignment with Kenya Vision 2030.

## 2. EdTech Implementation Landscape (Current State)

Kenya is one of Africa’s most active EdTech ecosystems, driven by both government and private innovation. The **Digital Literacy Programme (DLP)** launched in 2016 has equipped public primary schools with devices and digital content. The **Kenya National Digital Master Plan 2022–2032** and the **ICT in Education Policy (2019)** guide digital transformation across education sectors. Numerous donor and private sector initiatives (e.g. Eneza Education, eLimu, Google for Education partnerships) complement formal efforts. However, connectivity and electricity gaps persist in rural areas, and integration into classroom pedagogy remains uneven.

## 3. Core Pedagogy

**Key country insight:**  
Kenya’s Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) prioritises learner-centred, activity-based, and skills-oriented pedagogy, replacing rote exam-based learning.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Tools must align with **CBC learning outcomes** and competencies, not just subject content.  
- Must support **experiential learning**, project work, and formative feedback.  
- Pedagogical flexibility is encouraged, but **alignment with KICD-approved methods** is expected for classroom use.  
- Teacher guidance and scaffolding features are highly valued.  

**Requirement basis:** CBC Framework (2017), [KICD Curriculum Reforms](https://kicd.ac.ke/curriculum-reforms/)  

---

## 4. Focus Skills

**Key country insight:**  
National emphasis is on **digital literacy, critical thinking, communication, collaboration, creativity, and citizenship**—the “7 core competencies” outlined under CBC. Foundational literacy and numeracy remain a top priority under the *Tusome* programme.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Tools targeting **literacy, numeracy, and digital skills** are strongly prioritised.  
- Products promoting **problem-solving, STEM, and employability skills** align with policy emphasis.  
- Purely content-drill or test-prep products have limited systemic traction.

---

## 5. Content & Curriculum Alignment

**Key country insight:**  
All learning materials used in Kenyan public schools must be **approved by KICD** before deployment. This includes digital content and e-learning platforms.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- **KICD accreditation** is mandatory for curriculum-aligned content.  
- Alignment to **CBC strands and sub-strands** is required.  
- Localisation into **English and Kiswahili** (and sometimes indigenous languages) is expected.  
- Unapproved foreign content cannot be used for classroom instruction in public schools.

## 6. Teacher Professional Development

**Key country insight:**  
The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) oversees teacher qualification and continuous professional development (CPD). ICT integration is a core component of CPD under the **Teacher Professional Development Framework (2021)**.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Solutions should include **teacher training modules** or partner with TSC-accredited providers.  
- Tools must be usable within the **existing CPD structure**.  
- Capacity-building components are expected in all institutional deployments.

- [Teachers Service Commission: TPD Framework (PDF)](https://www.tsc.go.ke/images/TPD_FRAMEWORK.pdf)  
- [MoE ICT in Education Policy (2019)](https://ict.go.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ICT-in-Education-Policy-2019.pdf)

---

## 7. Assessment Approach

**Key country insight:**  
Kenya is transitioning from high-stakes summative exams to **continuous and formative assessment** under CBC, though the **Kenya National Examinations Council (KNEC)** still administers national assessments.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Tools should support **competency-based assessment** and evidence collection.  
- Alignment with **KNEC reporting formats** is advantageous.  
- Alternative or adaptive assessments are acceptable if mapped to CBC competencies.

## 8. Data Governance & Privacy

**Key country insight:**  
Kenya’s **Data Protection Act, 2019** (administered by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner – ODPC) regulates all personal data processing, including that of children.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- **Registration with ODPC** may be required for data controllers or processors.  
- Explicit **parental consent** is required for processing children’s data.  
- **Cross-border data transfers** must comply with adequacy or safeguard provisions.  
- Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) are expected for high-risk educational deployments.  

**Sources:**

## 9. Technical Interoperability

**Key country insight:**  
Kenya lacks a single national education platform but encourages interoperability through the **National Education Management Information System (NEMIS)** and the **Digital Literacy Programme**.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Integration with **NEMIS identifiers** (learner, teacher, school) is recommended for scale.  
- APIs or data export features enhancing interoperability with MoE systems are expected.  
- No mandated LMS standard (e.g., SCORM or LTI) identified, but open standards preferred.

## 10. Cybersecurity & Child Online Safety

**Key country insight:**  
Kenya’s **Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act (2018)** and the **National Cybersecurity Strategy (2022)** guide online protection, with child safety reinforced under the **Children Act (2022)**.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Platforms must implement **age-appropriate content controls** and **user authentication**.  
- **Incident response** and **data breach notification** procedures are mandatory.  
- Collaboration with the **National KE-CIRT/CC** for threat reporting is recommended.  

**Sources:**

## 11. Delivery Constraints & Design Preferences

**Key country insight:**  
While urban schools enjoy good connectivity, rural schools experience frequent electricity outages and limited broadband. Kenya’s **Rural Electrification and Connectivity Programme** and **Konza Digital Learning Initiatives** are ongoing.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- **Offline or low-bandwidth functionality** is essential.  
- Mobile-first design preferred (high smartphone penetration).  
- Local language and **audio-visual content** improve accessibility.  
- Energy-efficient hardware or solar-compatible devices are advantageous.

## 12. Notes & Gaps

- **Strict:** KICD approval for all instructional content; compliance with the Data Protection Act.  
- **Emerging:** Integration standards and CBC-aligned digital assessment tools.  
- **Gaps:** No public national interoperability framework for EdTech; limited open data protocols.  
- **Implications:** Vendors must budget for curriculum mapping, localisation, and KICD review timelines.  
- **Practical:** Offline capacity, teacher training modules, and clear data protection documentation are essential for procurement credibility.
