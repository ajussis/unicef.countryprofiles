EGYPT — EdTech Suitability & Compliance Profile

A structured, source-based overview to assess how well EdTech tools align with Egypt's education system, regulatory environment, digital policies, and real-world delivery conditions.

1. Core Pedagogy
Key country insight:
Egypt has a highly centralised education system, with the Ministry of Education overseeing curriculum development and implementation across all levels.

What this means for EdTech deployment:
- EdTech tools must align with the nationally prescribed curriculum.
- There is limited scope for teacher-led adaptation of digital tools.
- Approval from the Ministry of Education is required.

Requirement basis: Law / policy

2. Focus Skills
Key country insight:
The Egyptian education system places a strong emphasis on literacy, numeracy, and digital skills.

What this means for EdTech deployment:
- EdTech tools should focus on improving literacy and numeracy outcomes.
- Digital skills training is a priority area.

3. Content & Curriculum Alignment
Key country insight:
Curriculum alignment in Egypt is strict, and the Ministry of Education controls approval.

What this means for EdTech deployment:
- Formal curriculum mapping is required for all EdTech tools.
- Localisation and language adaptation to Arabic is expected.
- Foreign content may face challenges in gaining approval.

4. Teacher Professional Development
Key country insight:
In Egypt, teachers are expected to engage with digital tools, but training and support are often lacking.

What this means for EdTech deployment:
- EdTech providers are expected to include teacher training components.
- Accreditation of training programs may be necessary.

5. Assessment Approach
Key country insight:
Egypt's education system is heavily exam-oriented, with a focus on rote learning.

What this means for EdTech deployment:
- EdTech tools should align with national exam frameworks.
- Alternative assessment models may face resistance.

6. Data Governance & Privacy
Key country insight:
Egypt has strict data protection laws, but there is limited specific regulation on child data.

What this means for EdTech deployment:
- EdTech tools must comply with national data protection laws.
- The rules on child data are unclear, requiring careful navigation.

7. Technical Interoperability
Key country insight:
Egypt's digital education infrastructure is developing but remains inconsistent across regions.

What this means for EdTech deployment:
- EdTech tools may need to be compatible with a range of different systems and platforms.
- There are no strict interoperability standards, but this may change in the future.

8. Cybersecurity & Child Online Safety
Key country insight:
Egypt has robust cybersecurity laws, but child online safety is less well regulated.

What this means for EdTech deployment:
- EdTech tools must comply with national cybersecurity laws.
- Providers must ensure their own measures for child online safety.

9. Delivery Constraints & Design Preferences
Key country insight:
Internet connectivity and electricity supply can be unreliable, especially in rural areas.

What this means for EdTech deployment:
- EdTech tools should be designed for offline use or low-bandwidth conditions.

10. Notes & Gaps
- Strict requirements for curriculum alignment and teacher training.
- Emerging expectations around digital skills training.
- Gaps in regulations around child data protection and online safety.
- Localisation to Arabic and consideration for offline use are practical necessities.
