# Namibia — EdTech Suitability & Compliance Profile  

A structured, source-based overview to assess how well EdTech tools align with Namibia’s education framework, digital policy environment, regulatory requirements, and delivery realities.  

---

## 1. Core Pedagogy  
**Summary:**  
Namibia’s education system is guided by the *Education Act (2001, amended 2017)* and the *Sector Policy on Inclusive Education (2013)*, emphasizing learner-centered pedagogy and equitable access. The curriculum framework encourages competency-based and outcomes-oriented teaching, focusing on critical thinking, problem-solving, and lifelong learning. Foundational phases prioritize literacy and numeracy, while senior phases develop applied and vocational skills aligned with Vision 2030 and the *Fifth National Development Plan (NDP5)*.  

**Requirement Level:**  
Grounded in national policy and statutory instruments under the Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture (MoEAC).

## 2. Focus Skills  
**Summary:**  
Namibia’s curriculum and ICT policies aim to equip learners with 21st-century skills—digital literacy, communication, collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking. The *ICT Policy for Education (2005, updated 2018)* emphasizes integrating ICT literacy across subjects. Entrepreneurship, environmental awareness, and civic education are also cross-cutting skills promoted in secondary education.  

**Requirement Level:**  
Driven by MoEAC policy and Vision 2030 strategic priorities.

## 3. Content & Curriculum Alignment  
**Summary:**  
The *Curriculum Framework for Basic Education (2016)* defines national learning outcomes for pre-primary through senior secondary education. EdTech content should align with these learning areas and the competency-based structure. English is the official medium of instruction from Grade 4 upwards, requiring EdTech to support English-language delivery while accommodating local language integration in early grades.  

**Requirement Level:**  
Policy requirement anchored in MoEAC curriculum standards.

## 4. Teacher Professional Development  
**Summary:**  
Teacher digital competence is supported under the *ICT Professional Development Framework for Teachers (2010)* and NIED’s in-service training programmes. The framework is adapted from UNESCO’s ICT Competency Framework for Teachers (ICT-CFT). Ongoing professional learning is encouraged through blended and school-based initiatives, though capacity gaps remain in rural areas.  

**Requirement Level:**  
Programme-driven, supported by MoEAC and donor-funded initiatives (UNESCO, GIZ).

---

## 5. Assessment Approach  
**Summary:**  
Namibia uses continuous assessment and national examinations overseen by the Directorate of National Examinations and Assessment (DNEA). The *Assessment Policy for Schools (2017)* promotes formative and summative assessments aligned with learning outcomes. EdTech solutions must support evidence-based tracking, fairness, and confidentiality of learner data.  

**Requirement Level:**  
Policy-based under MoEAC; examination procedures have statutory backing under the Education Act.

## 6. Data Governance & Privacy  
**Summary:**  
Namibia’s *Data Protection Bill* is under development and not yet enacted. Until formal adoption, data handling is guided by the *Electronic Transactions and Cybercrime Act (2019)* and constitutional privacy provisions (Article 13, Namibian Constitution). Public institutions are expected to adhere to data minimization, consent, and security principles. No dedicated education data protection regulation currently exists.  

**Requirement Level:**  
Emerging legal framework; partial coverage under general cyber and electronic transaction laws.

- [Namibian Constitution (Article 13)](https://laws.parliament.na/constitution)

## 7. Technical Interoperability  
**Summary:**  
Namibia’s e-government initiatives are coordinated by the *Office of the Prime Minister* and MICT, which promote interoperability across government systems. The *National ICT Policy Framework (2018)* outlines the importance of open standards, metadata consistency, and government-wide digital integration. Education systems are encouraged to use compatible data formats with government and learning management platforms.  

**Requirement Level:**  
Policy-based, not yet codified into binding technical standards for education.

## 8. Cybersecurity & Child Online Safety  
**Summary:**  
Cybersecurity is governed by the *Electronic Transactions and Cybercrime Act (2019)*, which criminalizes unauthorized access and cyber exploitation. Namibia participates in *SADC* and *ITU* child online protection programmes, promoting awareness through the *Safer Internet Day Namibia* campaign. No standalone child online protection act exists, but schools are advised to adopt internal acceptable-use policies.  

**Requirement Level:**  
Legal (general cyber law) and programme-based (child safety awareness).

## 9. Delivery Constraints & Design Preferences  
**Summary:**  
Namibia faces significant digital divides between urban and rural schools. According to the World Bank and UNESCO UIS, school connectivity and device access remain uneven, with electricity access below 60% in some regions. Offline and low-bandwidth functionality are critical. Teacher ICT competence and maintenance capacity are limited outside main towns. Localisation (English plus regional languages) and offline content delivery (USB, preloaded tablets, radio, print) remain key design considerations.  

**Requirement Level:**  
Practical and programme-driven; referenced in NDP5 and the ICT Policy for Education.

## 10. Notes & Gaps  
- **Clear Requirements:** Curriculum alignment, learner-centred pedagogy, examination confidentiality, and cybersecurity under the 2019 Act.  
- **Emerging Expectations:** Data protection compliance and interoperability standards, pending the Data Protection Bill and digital transformation agenda.  
- **Gaps:** No specific EdTech accreditation or certification framework; limited public guidance on cloud data hosting and cross-border transfers.  
- **Practical Implications:** Vendors must provide data security assurances, support offline access, align with national curriculum outcomes, and enable teacher-led adaptation.  
- **Localization:** English-language content required for Grades 4+, but local language adaptation is beneficial for early learning.
