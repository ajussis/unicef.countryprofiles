# Ghana — EdTech Suitability & Compliance Profile

A structured, source-based overview to assess how well EdTech tools align with Ghana’s education system, regulatory environment, digital policies, and real-world delivery conditions.

---

## 1. Education System Overview (Context Setting)

Ghana’s education system is centrally governed by the **Ministry of Education (MoE)**, executed through agencies such as the **Ghana Education Service (GES)** and **National Teaching Council (NTC)**. It follows a **6-3-3-4 structure** (six years primary, three years junior high, three years senior high, and four years tertiary). Under the **Education Strategic Plan 2018–2030**, Ghana is committed to equitable access, quality improvement, and digital transformation in education. The curriculum was reformed in 2019 toward competency-based learning, emphasizing creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving.

## 2. EdTech Implementation Landscape (Current State)

Ghana is among Africa’s more digitally proactive education systems, with initiatives such as **Ghana Learning TV**, **Smart Schools Project**, and the **Centre for National Distance Learning and Open Schooling (CENDLOS)** supporting ICT in learning. However, digital learning adoption remains uneven, especially between urban and rural areas due to connectivity and device gaps. The **Digital Ghana Agenda** and **ICT in Education Policy (2015)** outline ambitions for full integration of ICT in teaching and learning, but implementation is still largely pilot-based and donor-supported (e.g., World Bank GALOP project and UNICEF Learning Passport pilots).

## 3. Core Pedagogy

**Key country insight:**  
Ghana’s curriculum is competency-based, emphasizing learner-centered methodologies, problem-solving, and critical thinking, replacing rote memorization under the 2019 reforms.

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**
- Align products with the 2019 competency-based curriculum framework.  
- Provide tools that support active, inquiry-driven pedagogy rather than passive content delivery.  
- Ensure teacher dashboards or lesson plans reflect competency attainment.  
- Secure MoE or NaCCA approval for instructional materials integrated into the national curriculum.

## 4. Focus Skills

**Key country insight:**  
Ghana prioritizes **foundational literacy and numeracy**, **digital literacy**, and **employability/life skills**. The 2019 curriculum embeds ICT and digital skills from basic education.

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**
- Tools that enhance reading, numeracy, and digital fluency are strongly aligned with national priorities.  
- Life skills, entrepreneurship, and STEM education are emerging focus areas.  
- Non-core or entertainment-based learning tools may face limited policy traction.

## 5. Content & Curriculum Alignment

**Key country insight:**  
The **National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NaCCA)** regulates curriculum content and must approve educational materials for use in schools.

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**
- All learning content used in public schools must be aligned with NaCCA’s approved syllabi.  
- Localization into Ghanaian English and, where applicable, local languages (e.g., Akan, Ewe) is encouraged.  
- Foreign content must be mapped to national standards and contextualized for Ghanaian learners.

---

## 6. Teacher Professional Development

**Key country insight:**  
Teacher training is governed by the **National Teaching Council (NTC)**, which mandates continuous professional development (CPD) and licensing.

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**
- Include embedded teacher training modules aligned with NTC CPD frameworks.  
- Partner with teacher colleges or GES for scalable capacity building.  
- EdTechs offering PD content must ensure accreditation from NTC.

---

## 7. Assessment Approach

**Key country insight:**  
Assessment remains exam-oriented, led by the **West African Examinations Council (WAEC)**, but internal reforms promote continuous assessment aligned with competencies.

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**
- Tools should report progress against curriculum competencies.  
- Integration with continuous assessment records (CA) will enhance usability.  
- Summative exam preparation tools must reflect WAEC standards.

## 8. Data Governance & Privacy

**Key country insight:**  
Ghana’s **Data Protection Act, 2012 (Act 843)** regulates personal data processing, enforced by the **Data Protection Commission (DPC)**. It applies to both public and private entities processing data in Ghana or of Ghanaian citizens.

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**
- Must register with the DPC if processing student or teacher data.  
- Obtain explicit consent for children’s data collection and processing.  
- Cross-border data transfer allowed only to countries with adequate protection.  
- Maintain secure storage and data minimization practices.

## 9. Technical Interoperability

**Key country insight:**  
No unified interoperability standard is enforced, but MoE and CENDLOS are building a **National Learning Management System (LMS)** and **Education Management Information System (EMIS)**.

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**
- Design APIs compatible with EMIS data exchange formats.  
- Ensure capability to integrate with CENDLOS or MoE systems.  
- No mandated open standards (e.g., SCORM, LTI), but interoperability readiness is advantageous.

## 10. Cybersecurity & Child Online Safety

**Key country insight:**  
Ghana’s **Cybersecurity Act, 2020 (Act 1038)** establishes the **Cyber Security Authority (CSA)** and promotes child online protection under the **National Child Online Protection Framework (2021)**.

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**
- Implement age-appropriate content filters and moderation systems.  
- Follow CSA’s cybersecurity best practices and report incidents.  
- Conduct basic cybersecurity awareness for teachers and learners.

## 11. Delivery Constraints & Design Preferences

**Key country insight:**  
Urban–rural digital divides persist: internet penetration ~68% (2023), rural connectivity and electricity access remain limited (~70%). Low-cost Android devices dominate; teachers often share devices.

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**
- Offline or low-bandwidth functionality is essential.  
- Mobile-first, data-light design preferred.  
- Multilingual interfaces improve accessibility.  
- Support asynchronous use and community-based learning centers.

## 12. Notes & Gaps

- **Strict requirements:** Data protection registration (Act 843), NaCCA curriculum alignment, NTC accreditation for teacher PD.  
- **Emerging expectations:** Interoperability with CENDLOS systems, integration with MoE EMIS, competency-based assessment analytics.  
- **Gaps:** No explicit national EdTech certification framework; limited public documentation on LMS technical standards.  
- **Practical implications:** Vendors must budget for curriculum mapping, teacher training, and offline functionality.  
- **Localization:** English primary language, but local language adaptation improves uptake.  
- **Data compliance:** Necessary to maintain DPC registration and consent logs.
