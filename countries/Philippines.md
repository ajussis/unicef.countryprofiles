# Philippines — EdTech Suitability & Compliance Profile  
A structured, source-based overview to assess how well EdTech tools align with the Philippines’ education system, regulatory environment, digital policies, and real-world delivery conditions.

---

## 1. Education System Overview (Context Setting)

The Philippines’ education system is governed centrally by the **Department of Education (DepEd)** for basic education, the **Commission on Higher Education (CHED)** for tertiary education, and the **Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA)** for technical-vocational training. The system follows a **K–12 curriculum** introduced through the **Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act No. 10533)**, comprising Kindergarten, six years of elementary, four years of junior high, and two years of senior high school. The country has been pursuing significant reforms toward competency-based learning and ICT integration in schools.

## 2. EdTech Implementation Landscape (Current State)

Digital learning adoption in the Philippines accelerated during COVID-19, with DepEd’s **Basic Education Learning Continuity Plan (BE-LCP, 2020)** integrating modular, online, and television/radio-based learning. The **DepEd Commons** serves as the national online platform for digital learning materials. Connectivity remains uneven: as of 2023, only around 68% of public schools had reliable internet access, and device availability varies widely. Implementation is largely **centralised in policy but fragmented in practice**, with private sector and donor-supported pilots supplementing national efforts.

## 3. Core Pedagogy

**Key country insight:**  
Teaching is governed by a **standards-based, outcomes-oriented curriculum** with prescribed competencies per grade level. Instruction is largely teacher-led, though DepEd is promoting learner-centered approaches and performance-based assessment.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Tools must align with the national **K–12 learning competencies**.  
- Content should support **teacher-facilitated learning**, not fully autonomous modes.  
- Adaptivity and formative assessment are valued but must map to DepEd standards.  
- Any deviation from the official curriculum requires DepEd approval.

**Requirement basis:** Republic Act No. 10533 (Enhanced Basic Education Act, 2013).

## 4. Focus Skills

**Key country insight:**  
National priorities emphasize **foundational literacy and numeracy**, **digital literacy**, and **21st-century skills** such as critical thinking, collaboration, and employability. The **Digital Rise Program (DepEd, 2020)** promotes ICT and computational thinking from early grades.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Strong demand for foundational, remedial, and digital skills platforms.  
- EdTechs addressing coding, STEM, and digital citizenship align with policy direction.  
- Less priority on niche or non-core subjects without clear curricular linkage.

## 5. Content & Curriculum Alignment

**Key country insight:**  
DepEd mandates that all learning resources align with **Most Essential Learning Competencies (MELCs)**. English and Filipino are the main languages of instruction, with mother-tongue-based instruction in early grades.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Must map content explicitly to MELCs per grade and subject.  
- Localization into Filipino and major regional languages (e.g., Cebuano, Ilocano) is expected for lower grades.  
- Foreign content must undergo DepEd screening and approval before classroom use.

## 6. Teacher Professional Development

**Key country insight:**  
DepEd operates the **National Educators Academy of the Philippines (NEAP)**, which accredits professional development programs. ICT integration is an ongoing focus through the **ICTS-EdTech Unit**.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Teacher training modules must be **NEAP-recognized** to count toward CPD credits.  
- Partnering with NEAP or DepEd regional offices is advisable for scale.  
- Tools should include teacher dashboards, training, and usage guides.

## 7. Assessment Approach

**Key country insight:**  
Assessment is shifting toward performance-based and formative approaches, though **national standardized tests** (e.g., NAT) remain central. DepEd also implements classroom-based formative assessments aligned with MELCs.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Tools must link assessments to MELCs and DepEd grading guidelines.  
- Alternative assessment models are acceptable if they complement—not replace—DepEd formats.  
- Data outputs should be compatible with DepEd reporting frameworks.

**Sources:**  
- [DepEd Order No. 8, s. 2015: Policy Guidelines on Classroom Assessment](https://www.deped.gov.ph/2015/04/01/do-8-s-2015-policy-guidelines-on-classroom-assessment-for-the-k-to-12-basic-education-program/)  

---

## 8. Data Governance & Privacy

**Key country insight:**  
The **Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173)** regulates all personal data processing. The **National Privacy Commission (NPC)** oversees compliance and has issued specific guidance for educational institutions and online learning platforms.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Must appoint a **Data Protection Officer (DPO)** and register with NPC if processing student data.  
- Requires **informed consent** from data subjects or guardians.  
- **Cross-border data transfers** allowed only with adequate safeguards.  
- Data breach notification to NPC and affected parties within 72 hours.

- [National Privacy Commission: Guidelines for Online Learning (2020)](https://privacy.gov.ph/news/educational-institutions-online-learning-guidelines/)  

---

## 9. Technical Interoperability

**Key country insight:**  
DepEd uses several digital platforms (e.g., **DepEd Commons**, **Learning Management System**, **Learner Information System**), but no formal open interoperability framework (e.g., SCORM, LTI) is mandated nationally.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Integration with DepEd LMS requires coordination with the **ICTS-EdTech Unit**.  
- APIs or CSV data exchange may be used where standards are undefined.  
- No national edtech certification framework currently exists.

## 10. Cybersecurity & Child Online Safety

**Key country insight:**  
The **Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (RA 10175)** and **Child Online Safeguarding Policy (DepEd Order No. 40, s. 2012)** establish obligations to protect minors from online abuse, exploitation, and inappropriate content.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Platforms must include **content filtering, moderation, and reporting mechanisms**.  
- Must adhere to DepEd’s **Child Protection Policy** in all online interactions.  
- Terms of service should explicitly reference compliance with RA 10175 and RA 7610 (Child Abuse Law).

**Sources:**

## 11. Delivery Constraints & Design Preferences

**Key country insight:**  
Despite national ICT initiatives, **bandwidth, electricity, and device access** remain inconsistent, particularly in rural and island provinces. Teachers often rely on mobile devices and offline materials.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Tools must function **offline or in low-bandwidth settings**.  
- Lightweight mobile-first design is essential.  
- Local language support improves accessibility.  
- Options for downloadable or print-based materials are valuable.

## 12. Notes & Gaps

- **Strict requirements:** Data privacy compliance (RA 10173), DepEd content approval, NEAP accreditation for teacher training.  
- **Emerging expectations:** Interoperability and AI ethics not yet codified but under discussion within DepEd ICTS.  
- **Gaps:** No national EdTech certification or interoperability standard; limited public documentation on API or integration protocols.  
- **Implementation reality:** Offline functionality, low-data designs, and localized content remain critical.  
- **Vendor implication:** High upfront curriculum mapping effort; privacy documentation and DepEd coordination required for scale.
