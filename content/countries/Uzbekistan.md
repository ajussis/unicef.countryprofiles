# Uzbekistan — EdTech Suitability & Compliance Profile

A structured, source-based overview to assess how well EdTech tools align with Uzbekistan’s education system, regulatory environment, digital policies, and real-world delivery conditions.

---

## 1. Education System Overview (Context Setting)

Uzbekistan’s education system is highly centralised and overseen by the **Ministry of Preschool and School Education (MoPSE)**, the **Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation**, and other line ministries. The system includes preschool (ages 3–6), general secondary (grades 1–11), secondary specialised/vocational, and higher education. Since 2017, the government has been implementing major reforms under the **“Development Strategy of New Uzbekistan 2022–2026”**, emphasising quality improvement, digitalisation, and international alignment.

## 2. EdTech Implementation Landscape (Current State)

Uzbekistan has made EdTech a national priority through the **Digital Education Concept (2021)** and the **Digital Uzbekistan 2030 Strategy**, which promote e-learning, digital content, and ICT infrastructure in schools. The state platform **EduMarket.uz** serves as a central repository of digital learning materials, and the **EduOnline** and **ZiyoNET** portals provide digital resources for teachers and students. However, device access remains uneven, and rural schools face limited connectivity. Donor-supported initiatives (e.g., UNICEF’s Digital Learning Passport and World Bank’s Modernizing Uzbekistan Education Project) complement national efforts.

## 3. Core Pedagogy

**Key country insight:**  
Teaching and learning are aligned with a **nationally standardised curriculum** and centralised pedagogical guidance. The country is gradually introducing competency-based and digital learning methods but remains exam- and content-oriented.

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**  
- Solutions must align closely with state curriculum frameworks.  
- Flexibility for teacher-generated content exists but requires MoPSE approval.  
- Demonstrations of curriculum alignment are critical for adoption.  
- Tools that support teacher-directed learning and core subject mastery are preferred.

## 4. Focus Skills

**Key country insight:**  
National priorities emphasise **STEM, digital literacy, foreign languages (especially English), and 21st-century competencies**. Foundational literacy and numeracy remain a central concern in early grades.

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**  
- Tools supporting digital skills, coding, and English language learning have strong policy alignment.  
- Foundational skill reinforcement remains a donor priority.  
- Soft skills and creativity are emerging but not yet formalised in assessment structures.

## 5. Content & Curriculum Alignment

**Key country insight:**  
All educational content used in public schools must correspond to the **State Educational Standards** approved by MoPSE. Educational resources undergo expert review before school-level adoption.

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**  
- Curriculum mapping to national standards is mandatory for MoPSE approval.  
- Uzbek and Russian are the primary languages of instruction; Uzbek localisation is essential.  
- Importing foreign digital content requires regulatory review.

## 6. Teacher Professional Development

**Key country insight:**  
Teacher professional development is regulated and increasingly digitised. The **National Center for Training and Retraining of Teachers** leads capacity-building efforts, supported by donor digital upskilling programs.

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**  
- EdTech solutions should include integrated teacher training modules.  
- Alignment with national teacher competency frameworks increases acceptance.  
- Programs using a cascade model (training-of-trainers) are preferred for scale.

---

## 7. Assessment Approach

**Key country insight:**  
Assessment is dominated by **national exams and centralised testing**. Formative assessment is being introduced gradually through pilot innovations.

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**  
- Tools should support preparation for national exams and tracking of student mastery.  
- Alternative or adaptive assessments must complement, not replace, official formats.  
- Integration with state reporting systems is advantageous but technically limited.

## 8. Data Governance & Privacy

**Key country insight:**  
The **Law on Personal Data (No. ZRU-547, 2019)** establishes data localisation requirements—personal data of Uzbek citizens must be stored on servers within Uzbekistan. The **State Inspectorate for Supervision of Information and Telecommunications Technologies (Uzkomnazorat)** enforces compliance.

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**  
- User data must be hosted on servers located in Uzbekistan.  
- Explicit consent is required for processing personal data, especially for minors.  
- Cross-border data transfers require state permission.  

**Sources:**  
- [Law on Personal Data (ZRU-547, 2019)](https://lex.uz/docs/4396428)  
- [Uzkomnazorat – Data Protection Oversight](https://uzkomnazorat.uz/)

---

## 9. Technical Interoperability

**Key country insight:**  
No formal national interoperability framework exists for EdTech, but integration with **ZiyoNET** and **EduMarket** is encouraged. The government promotes use of national authentication services.

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**  
- APIs or data exchange with MoPSE platforms may be required for scale.  
- Use of national Single Sign-On (SSO) systems is recommended.  
- Lack of formal standards means integration is negotiated case by case.

## 10. Cybersecurity & Child Online Safety

**Key country insight:**  
The **Law on Informatization (2003, amended 2020)** and the **Strategy for Cybersecurity of the Republic of Uzbekistan (2022)** set general obligations for data and network security. Child online protection is guided by MoPSE’s digital safety programs in cooperation with UNICEF.

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**  
- Platforms must implement strong user authentication and content moderation.  
- Child-appropriate safeguards (no ads, safe communication tools) are expected.  
- Compliance with national cybersecurity standards is required for public-sector use.

## 11. Delivery Constraints & Design Preferences

**Key country insight:**  
Rural connectivity and device availability remain major constraints. The government’s **Universal Access Program** aims to expand broadband coverage, but many schools still operate with limited bandwidth.

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**  
- Offline or low-bandwidth functionality is essential for nationwide reach.  
- Mobile-first and lightweight web apps are preferred.  
- Uzbek and Russian language options are mandatory for accessibility.  
- Energy-efficient and device-agnostic design improves usability in rural areas.

## 12. Notes & Gaps

- **Clear requirements:** Data localisation (mandatory), curriculum alignment, language localisation.  
- **Emerging expectations:** Integration with national portals, teacher digital competence alignment.  
- **Gaps:** No dedicated child data protection law beyond general privacy legislation.  
- **Ambiguities:** Lack of explicit national EdTech accreditation standards.  
- **Vendor implications:** Expect high localisation and hosting costs; need for curriculum mapping; offline functionality is a practical necessity; teacher professional development integration is a differentiator.
