# India — EdTech Suitability & Compliance Profile  

A structured, source-based overview to assess how well EdTech tools align with India’s education system, regulatory environment, digital policies, and real-world delivery conditions.  

---

## 1. Education System Overview (Context Setting)

India’s education system is **federal but highly centralised in curriculum direction** through national frameworks set by the [Ministry of Education (MoE)](https://www.education.gov.in/) and the [National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)](https://ncert.nic.in/). The structure follows the 5+3+3+4 model under the **National Education Policy (NEP) 2020**, covering foundational, preparatory, middle, and secondary stages. States manage school-level administration but align curricula with national standards. Tertiary education is overseen by the University Grants Commission (UGC).

## 2. EdTech Implementation Landscape (Current State)

India has a **rapidly expanding EdTech ecosystem**, combining large-scale public platforms and private innovation. The government operates flagship digital initiatives such as **DIKSHA** (Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing), **SWAYAM** for higher education MOOCs, and **PM eVidya** for multimodal access. However, **infrastructure disparities** persist—rural connectivity and device access remain limited, and electricity reliability varies by region. Private EdTech adoption is strong in urban areas, while public-school integration depends on state capacity and teacher readiness.

## 3. Core Pedagogy

**Key insight:**  
India’s pedagogy remains **curriculum-driven and exam-oriented**, but NEP 2020 promotes a **competency-based, experiential approach** that values flexibility and learner-centred methods.  

**Implications for EdTech:**  
- Align content with **NCERT/SCERT learning outcomes**.  
- Support **competency-based and formative learning** rather than rote memorisation.  
- Ensure **state-level adaptation** for varied SCERT curricula.  
- Provide **bilingual or multilingual interfaces** in line with local medium of instruction.  
- Demonstrate compatibility with **NEP 2020 competencies** for credibility in procurement.

## 4. Focus Skills

**Key insight:**  
India’s NEP 2020 prioritises **foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN)**, **digital skills**, **21st-century skills**, and **vocational integration** from early grades.  

**Implications for EdTech:**  
- Tools targeting **FLN and digital literacy** have top policy alignment.  
- Integration of **coding, computational thinking, and life skills** aligns with national priorities.  
- Employability and vocational skill EdTechs should map to **National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)** levels.

## 5. Content & Curriculum Alignment

**Key insight:**  
Curriculum alignment is anchored in **NCERT and SCERT frameworks**, with DIKSHA hosting all approved digital content. States may localise content, but national mapping is required for public use.  

**Implications for EdTech:**  
- Must map content to **NCERT/SCERT learning outcomes** for official adoption.  
- Multilingual localisation (especially Hindi and regional languages) is mandatory for scale.  
- Foreign or generic content must undergo **pedagogical vetting** for contextual relevance.  
- Integration with **DIKSHA content repository** preferred for public deployments.  

**Sources:**  
- [DIKSHA – Content Guidelines](https://diksha.gov.in/help/)  
- [NCERT Curriculum Framework (2023)](https://ncert.nic.in/pdf/NCF/National_Curriculum_Framework_School_Education_2023.pdf) (PDF)

## 6. Teacher Professional Development

**Key insight:**  
Teacher upskilling is a major NEP 2020 pillar, with digital PD delivered through **NISHTHA (National Initiative for School Heads’ and Teachers’ Holistic Advancement)** on DIKSHA.  

**Implications for EdTech:**  
- PD content must align with **NISHTHA competency areas**.  
- Platforms must support **certificate tracking** integrated with DIKSHA.  
- Teacher-facing EdTechs should include **multilingual, low-data modules** and **peer-learning features**.  

**Sources:**  
- [NISHTHA Portal](https://nishtha.ncert.gov.in/)  
- [MoE – Teacher Education Reforms (2023)](https://www.education.gov.in/en/teacher-education)  

---

## 7. Assessment Approach

**Key insight:**  
NEP 2020 introduces a **comprehensive, competency-based assessment reform**, moving from rote exams to holistic progress tracking through the **PARAKH** (Performance Assessment, Review, and Analysis of Knowledge for Holistic Development) agency.  

**Implications for EdTech:**  
- Must support **formative and adaptive assessments** aligned with NEP competencies.  
- Integration with **PARAKH framework** enhances compliance for school use.  
- High-stakes test-prep tools remain market-driven but not policy-prioritised.  

**Sources:**  
- [PARAKH – NCERT Assessment Framework](https://ncert.nic.in/PARAKH.php)  
- [NEP 2020 – Assessments and Examinations Section](https://www.education.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/NEP_Final_English_0.pdf) (PDF)

## 8. Data Governance & Privacy

**Key insight:**  
India enacted the **Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP Act)**, regulating personal data processing, consent, and children’s data (below 18 years). The **Data Protection Board of India** oversees compliance.  

**Implications for EdTech:**  
- Must obtain **verifiable parental consent** for minors.  
- Data can be transferred abroad only if the **Central Government permits** the destination jurisdiction.  
- Ensure **data minimisation, breach notification, and purpose limitation**.  
- Public-sector deployments may require **onshore data storage**.

- [MeitY – Data Governance Framework](https://www.meity.gov.in/)  

---

## 9. Technical Interoperability

**Key insight:**  
India promotes **open standards and federated digital infrastructure** through the **India Stack** and **DIKSHA’s open-source Sunbird framework**.  

**Implications for EdTech:**  
- DIKSHA integrations should use **Sunbird APIs and metadata schemas**.  
- Prefer **open, standards-based interoperability (SCORM/xAPI)** for content and LMS.  
- Support for **Digital Infrastructure for School Education (DISE/UDISE+)** data exchange expected in government projects.  

**Sources:**  
- [Sunbird – Open Source Framework](https://www.sunbird.org/)  
- [UDISE+ Data System](https://udiseplus.gov.in/)

## 10. Cybersecurity & Child Online Safety

**Key insight:**  
Cybersecurity is governed by the **Information Technology Act, 2000**, with operational guidance under **CERT-In** rules (2022). Child protection online is reinforced by **POSCO Act (2012)** and **National Cybersecurity Policy (draft 2023)**.  

**Implications for EdTech:**  
- Must implement **reasonable security practices** under IT Act Section 43A.  
- **Report cyber incidents** to CERT-In within 6 hours (2022 directive).  
- Child-facing platforms must filter or moderate harmful content.  
- Mandatory **grievance redressal mechanisms** for user complaints.  

**Sources:**  
- [CERT-In 2022 Guidelines](https://www.cert-in.org.in/PDF/CERT-In_Directions_70B_28.04.2022.pdf) (PDF)

## 11. Delivery Constraints & Design Preferences

**Key insight:**  
India faces **persistent digital divides** — only about 25–30% of rural households have internet access, and device sharing is common. Multilingual diversity and electricity reliability shape product usability.  

**Implications for EdTech:**  
- Include **offline and low-bandwidth modes**.  
- Optimize for **mobile-first Android devices**.  
- Provide **multilingual support** (minimum Hindi + English + local language).  
- Design content to work on **intermittent power connections**.  
- Integrate **SMS or IVR-based outreach** for low-connectivity contexts.  

**Sources:**

## 12. Notes & Gaps

- **Strict requirements:** Data protection (DPDP Act 2023), cybersecurity (CERT-In), and curriculum alignment (NCERT/SCERT).  
- **Emerging expectations:** Competency-based assessment (PARAKH), open interoperability (Sunbird API), and teacher PD integration (NISHTHA).  
- **Gaps:** No dedicated national EdTech accreditation or content vetting body beyond DIKSHA; unclear enforcement on data localisation for private EdTechs.  
- **Practical implications:** Vendors must invest in **curriculum mapping**, **multilingual localisation**, and **offline capabilities**.  
- **Cost drivers:** Compliance documentation for DPDP, integration with DIKSHA, and accessibility testing in low-resource settings.
