# Benin — EdTech Suitability & Compliance Profile  
A structured, source-based overview to assess how well EdTech tools align with Benin’s education system, regulatory environment, digital policies, and real-world delivery conditions.  

---

## 1. Education System Overview (Context Setting)

**Overview:**  
Benin’s education system is overseen centrally by the *Ministry of Nursery and Primary Education (MEMP)*, the *Ministry of Secondary, Technical and Vocational Education (MESFTP)*, and the *Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MESRS)*. The system follows a 6–4–3 structure: six years of primary, four years of lower secondary, and three years of upper secondary education. Basic education is compulsory for children aged 6 to 11. In recent years, Benin has pursued reforms toward competency-based curricula and expanded technical and vocational education to enhance employability.

## 2. EdTech Implementation Landscape (Current State)

**Overview:**  
ICT integration in Benin’s education sector remains limited but growing. The government’s *Digital Transformation Strategy (2021–2025)* and *Benin Digital 2025 Vision* promote the use of digital platforms in public services, including education. EdTech use is largely donor-driven—UNICEF, the World Bank, and AFD have supported pilot digital learning initiatives and ICT-equipped classrooms. Connectivity gaps persist, especially in rural areas where electricity and internet access are unreliable. Most schools use basic ICT tools, while learning management systems (LMS) and digital content libraries are still in nascent stages.

## 3. Core Pedagogy  

**Key country insight:**  
Benin’s pedagogy is transitioning from rote-learning toward competency-based education (CBE), guided by national curriculum reform since 2005 and reinforced in successive education plans. Instruction is still largely teacher-centered, with national exams driving classroom practices.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**  
- Align digital content with CBE frameworks that emphasize problem-solving and applied competencies.  
- Tools should allow structured lesson delivery but support incremental teacher-led adaptation.  
- Pilots must demonstrate conformity with national syllabi to gain ministry endorsement.  
- Assessment-linked EdTechs should reflect existing exam structures.

## 4. Focus Skills  

**Key country insight:**  
Benin prioritizes foundational literacy and numeracy, ICT literacy, and technical/vocational skills aligned with its *Education Sector Plan (2018–2030)* and *Digital Economy Strategy (2021–2025)*. Employability and entrepreneurship are strong themes in upper secondary and TVET curricula.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**  
- Solutions addressing foundational skills (reading, arithmetic) have highest policy alignment.  
- Tools supporting digital literacy and coding for youth align with national ICT education goals.  
- Upper secondary solutions should integrate vocational and entrepreneurial modules.

## 5. Content & Curriculum Alignment  

**Key country insight:**  
Benin follows a national curriculum defined by the MEMP and MESFTP, with French as the main language of instruction. Local languages are used in early grades in some regions. All educational materials and digital content used in public schools require ministry approval.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**  
- EdTech content must align explicitly with Benin’s national curriculum structure.  
- French-language content is mandatory for primary and secondary; bilingual (local + French) options are advantageous.  
- Foreign content must be locally adapted and authorized by the Ministry before classroom use.

## 6. Teacher Professional Development  

**Key country insight:**  
Teacher training is managed by national teacher training institutions under MEMP and MESFTP. ICT integration into teacher education is emerging but uneven, supported by donor projects promoting digital pedagogy.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**  
- EdTech providers should include structured teacher onboarding modules in any project design.  
- Training materials should be approved or co-developed with national teacher training institutes.  
- A cascade model (training of trainers) is preferred for national scalability.

## 7. Assessment Approach  

**Key country insight:**  
National exams (CEP, BEPC, BAC) dominate assessment practices. Continuous and formative assessments are encouraged on paper but not consistently implemented.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**  
- Digital assessment tools must map to national exam competencies.  
- Alternative or adaptive assessments should complement—not replace—summative testing.  
- Ministry validation is required for official use of digital exams or grading tools.

## 8. Data Governance & Privacy  

**Key country insight:**  
Benin’s personal data protection is governed by *Law No. 2009-09 on the Protection of Personal Data*, enforced by the *Autorité de Protection des Données Personnelles (APDP)*. The law applies to both public and private entities, including digital education platforms.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**  
- Obtain APDP authorization for any personal data processing.  
- Explicit consent is required for processing children’s data.  
- Cross-border data transfers need prior APDP approval.  
- Maintain data processing registers and security documentation.

## 9. Technical Interoperability  

**Key country insight:**  
No national EdTech interoperability standard is yet in force. However, the government’s digital transformation agenda promotes integration with e-government platforms under *Agence du Numérique du Bénin (ANID)*.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**  
- No mandated technical standard (e.g., SCORM, LTI) identified.  
- Interoperability with national education management systems may become a requirement as systems mature.  
- Providers should design open APIs and data export options to facilitate future integration.

## 10. Cybersecurity & Child Online Safety  

**Key country insight:**  
Benin has adopted a *National Cybersecurity Strategy (2018)* and established the *Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des Systèmes d’Information (ANSSI)*. Child online protection provisions are referenced in the *Children’s Code (2015)* and the *Cybercrime Law (2017)*.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**  
- Platforms must implement strong authentication and encryption measures.  
- Child-directed platforms must enforce age-appropriate content filters.  
- Report mechanisms for online abuse or exploitation are expected.

## 11. Delivery Constraints & Design Preferences  

**Key country insight:**  
Connectivity and electricity access remain uneven: only about 34% of households have internet access (ITU, 2023), and rural electrification is below 50%. Device availability in schools is limited, though smartphone use is rising among youth.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment (actionable):**  
- Prioritize offline or low-bandwidth functionality and mobile-first design.  
- Enable local caching or downloadable content for intermittent connectivity.  
- Support operation in French and optionally in local languages for inclusivity.  
- Plan for hybrid implementation (digital + print).

## 12. Notes & Gaps  

- **Strict requirements:** Data protection (Law 2009-09); ministry approval for educational content; APDP oversight for cross-border data transfers.  
- **Emerging expectations:** Integration with national digital platforms (ANID), teacher training on ICT pedagogy, cybersecurity compliance.  
- **Gaps:** No dedicated EdTech policy, no defined interoperability standards, limited open data guidance.  
- **Practical implications:**  
  - High localisation effort (French-first, curriculum mapping).  
  - Data documentation and APDP compliance required before launch.  
  - Offline functionality and low-spec design are critical for viability.  
  - Expect pilot validation through ministry partnership before national scaling.
