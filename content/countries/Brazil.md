# Brazil — EdTech Suitability & Compliance Profile  
*A structured, source-based overview to assess how well EdTech tools align with Brazil’s education system, regulatory environment, digital policies, and real-world delivery conditions.*

## 1. Education System Overview (Context Setting)

Brazil’s education system is **federal and highly decentralised**, with responsibilities shared among the federal government (Ministry of Education – [MEC](https://www.gov.br/mec/pt-br)), 26 states, the Federal District, and 5,570 municipalities. The **National Education Guidelines and Framework Law (LDB, 1996)** defines the general structure: early childhood education, primary (Ensino Fundamental, 9 years), secondary (Ensino Médio, 3 years), and higher education. The national curriculum is guided by the **Base Nacional Comum Curricular (BNCC)**, implemented progressively since 2017 to ensure minimum learning standards nationwide.

## 2. EdTech Implementation Landscape (Current State)

Digital education in Brazil is **uneven across regions**, reflecting disparities in connectivity, infrastructure, and teacher readiness. The **Programa Educação Conectada (Connected Education Program)**, launched in 2017 by MEC, aims to expand broadband and digital resources in public schools. State-level virtual learning environments (e.g., São Paulo’s **Centro de Mídias SP**) and national platforms like **AVAMEC** support blended learning and teacher training. Private schools and higher education institutions are more digitally mature, while rural and low-income areas remain under-connected. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated adoption but exposed inequities in device access and digital literacy.

## 3. Core Pedagogy

**Key insight:**  
Brazil’s pedagogy is structured around the **BNCC competency-based framework**, emphasizing skills development and contextualized learning. However, implementation remains heterogeneous due to decentralization and resource variation across states.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- ☐ Solutions must align with BNCC competencies and skills-based learning approaches.  
- ☐ Content should support flexible teacher-led adaptation, not rigid scripted delivery.  
- ☐ Expect state-level autonomy: localization by region may be required.  
- ☐ Tools that scaffold active learning and formative assessment fit current pedagogical directions.

## 4. Focus Skills

**Key insight:**  
The BNCC prioritizes **foundational literacy and numeracy**, **digital skills**, and **socio-emotional competencies** (Competências Gerais). Recent national plans (e.g., *Estratégia Nacional de Educação Digital*, 2023) emphasize **digital inclusion and coding skills**.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- ☐ Strong relevance for literacy, numeracy, digital citizenship, and STEM-aligned platforms.  
- ☐ EdTechs promoting critical thinking, collaboration, and socio-emotional learning align with BNCC goals.  
- ☐ Purely test-prep or rote-learning models are less aligned with current priorities.

**Sources:**

- [Estratégia Nacional de Educação Digital – Decree No. 11.483/2023](https://www.in.gov.br/en/web/dou/-/decreto-n-11.483-de-6-de-junho-de-2023-487435029)  

---

## 5. Content & Curriculum Alignment

**Key insight:**  
The BNCC defines national learning goals for all subjects; all educational materials used in public schools must align with it. The **National Textbook Program (PNLD)** evaluates and approves instructional materials, including digital resources.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- ☐ EdTech content must explicitly map to BNCC standards for adoption in public schools.  
- ☐ Portuguese-language localisation is mandatory.  
- ☐ Non-aligned or foreign curricula require contextual adaptation and official review for use in public settings.

## 6. Teacher Professional Development

**Key insight:**  
Teacher training is a central policy focus, with MEC’s **AVAMEC** platform offering national-scale professional development. Training is shifting toward digital pedagogy and hybrid learning skills.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- ☐ Products that include embedded teacher training or integrate with AVAMEC are favored.  
- ☐ State education secretariats may require accreditation or partnership for teacher PD programs.  
- ☐ Capacity-building components are often prerequisites for procurement.

---

## 7. Assessment Approach

**Key insight:**  
Brazil’s national assessment system (SAEB) measures learning outcomes aligned with BNCC, emphasizing literacy and numeracy. There is growing interest in formative assessment tools, though national exams remain summative.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- ☐ Assessment tools should align with BNCC indicators and SAEB frameworks.  
- ☐ Formative and adaptive analytics are welcome, but not substitutes for official assessments.  
- ☐ Integration with school reporting systems may be required for scale.

## 8. Data Governance & Privacy

**Key insight:**  
Brazil’s **General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados – LGPD, Law No. 13.709/2018)** regulates personal data processing, including children’s data. The **National Data Protection Authority (ANPD)** oversees compliance.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- ☐ Legal basis and parental consent are required for processing minors’ data.  
- ☐ Clear privacy policies in Portuguese are mandatory.  
- ☐ Cross-border transfers require adequate safeguards or ANPD-approved mechanisms.  
- ☐ Data minimisation and security-by-design principles must be demonstrated.

- [ANPD Official Portal](https://www.gov.br/anpd/pt-br)

## 9. Technical Interoperability

**Key insight:**  
Brazil lacks a single national interoperability standard for EdTech, but MEC and states increasingly adopt **open standards (e.g., SCORM, LTI)** for LMS and digital content. Integration with AVAMEC and local EMIS systems is encouraged.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- ☐ Ensure compatibility with SCORM/LTI for LMS integration.  
- ☐ Support API-level interoperability where state systems require it.  
- ☐ Documentation of integration architecture facilitates procurement.

## 10. Cybersecurity & Child Online Safety

**Key insight:**  
Brazil’s **Marco Civil da Internet (Law No. 12.965/2014)** and **LGPD** provide a general framework for data security and user rights. The **Statute of the Child and Adolescent (ECA, Law No. 8.069/1990)** mandates special protection for minors online.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- ☐ Implement encryption and secure authentication for all user data.  
- ☐ Avoid targeted advertising or profiling of minors.  
- ☐ Mechanisms for parental oversight and reporting of abuse are recommended.

## 11. Delivery Constraints & Design Preferences

**Key insight:**  
Connectivity and device access remain highly unequal: as of 2023, only **67% of public schools** had high-speed internet (World Bank). Many rural schools rely on mobile broadband or offline materials.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- ☐ Design for low bandwidth and offline functionality.  
- ☐ Ensure compatibility with mobile devices (Android preferred).  
- ☐ Consider regional language and cultural diversity.  
- ☐ Include teacher guides for offline or blended use.

## 12. Notes & Gaps

- **Strict requirements:** LGPD compliance (data protection), BNCC alignment (curriculum), Portuguese-language localisation.  
- **Emerging expectations:** interoperability (open standards), digital pedagogy training integration.  
- **Gaps:** no unified national EdTech accreditation or interoperability framework; state-level variation is high.  
- **Practical implications:**  
  - Curriculum mapping to BNCC is resource-intensive but essential for credibility.  
  - Documentation of data handling and security is mandatory for procurement.  
  - Offline capabilities remain a major differentiator for equitable deployment.
