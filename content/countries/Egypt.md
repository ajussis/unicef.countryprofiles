# Egypt — EdTech Suitability & Compliance Profile  
A structured, source-based overview to assess how well EdTech tools align with Egypt’s education system, regulatory environment, digital policies, and real-world delivery conditions.

## 1. Education System Overview (Context Setting)

**Overview:**  
Egypt’s education system is highly centralised under the [Ministry of Education and Technical Education (MoETE)](https://moe.gov.eg/). It includes pre-primary, basic (grades 1–9), secondary (general and technical), and higher education, with a strong emphasis on national curricula and examinations. The system has undergone major reforms under the *Education 2.0* framework launched in 2018, which aims to shift toward competency-based learning, digital content use, and improved teacher capacity.

## 2. EdTech Implementation Landscape (Current State)

**Overview:**  
Egypt’s *Education 2.0* reform integrates digital platforms such as the [Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB)](https://www.ekb.eg/) and the [MoETE Learning Platform](https://moe.gov.eg/) for K–12. Public schools increasingly use tablets and digital content in secondary education, supported by the World Bank’s *Supporting Egypt Education Reform Project (2018–2024)*. However, connectivity and device access remain uneven, especially in rural and technical schools. Private sector and donor-backed initiatives complement the government platforms but remain fragmented.

## 3. Core Pedagogy

**Key country insight:**  
Egypt’s teaching remains largely exam-oriented and centrally controlled, though *Education 2.0* promotes active learning and skills-based pedagogy in early grades.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- EdTech must align with centralised MoETE curricula and approval processes.  
- Tools supporting formative assessment and self-paced learning should complement, not replace, prescribed content.  
- Adaptive learning or teacher autonomy features may face limited uptake without MoETE endorsement.  
- Integration with teacher-led classroom use is essential.  

**Requirement basis:** National education reform policy (*Education 2.0*, MoETE 2018).

## 4. Focus Skills

**Key country insight:**  
National priorities emphasise foundational literacy and numeracy, digital skills, and employability competencies aligned with Egypt Vision 2030.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Solutions addressing early-grade literacy/numeracy, STEM, and digital literacy are most relevant.  
- Vocational and life skills tools should align with *Technical Education 2.0* standards.  
- Creativity or soft-skills tools must link to frameworks endorsed by MoETE or TVET authorities.

- [MoETE – Technical Education Reform (PDF)](https://moe.gov.eg/)  

---

## 5. Content & Curriculum Alignment

**Key country insight:**  
Curriculum content is standardised nationally; digital materials used in schools must be approved by MoETE and aligned with EKB or national textbooks.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Curriculum mapping to national learning outcomes is mandatory for public school use.  
- Arabic localisation is essential; bilingual (Arabic/English) support is preferred for STEM.  
- Foreign content requires prior approval from MoETE.  

**Sources:**  
- [MoETE – Curriculum Frameworks](https://moe.gov.eg/)  
- [EKB – Content Partnership Guidelines](https://www.ekb.eg/)

## 6. Teacher Professional Development

**Key country insight:**  
Teacher training is a central pillar of *Education 2.0*, delivered through MoETE’s Professional Academy for Teachers (PAT) and supported by digital courses on EKB.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- EdTechs offering teacher-facing content must coordinate with PAT for accreditation.  
- Blended PD models (online + in-person) are favoured.  
- Tools should integrate with MoETE/EKB PD ecosystems.  

**Sources:**  
- [Professional Academy for Teachers (PAT)](https://pat.edu.eg/)  
- [World Bank – Egypt Education Reform](https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P157809)  

---

## 7. Assessment Approach

**Key country insight:**  
National exams remain the dominant assessment mechanism, but digital and formative assessments are being introduced gradually through tablet-based testing at secondary level.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Assessment tools must align with national standards and MoETE item banks.  
- Alternative assessments (e.g. portfolios) are acceptable only as supplements.  
- Integration with MoETE’s digital testing systems is expected for secondary-grade deployments.

## 8. Data Governance & Privacy

**Key country insight:**  
Egypt enacted the [Personal Data Protection Law No. 151/2020](https://www.cit.gov.eg/en/Data_Protection_Law) and its 2024 Executive Regulations, overseen by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) and the Data Protection Centre.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Explicit consent is required for collecting student data.  
- Cross-border data transfer is restricted without MCIT approval.  
- Controllers must register with the Data Protection Centre.  
- Child data handling must follow enhanced consent and security measures.

- [MCIT – Data Protection Overview](https://mcit.gov.eg/en/Digital_Egypt/Data_Protection)  

---

## 9. Technical Interoperability

**Key country insight:**  
Egypt’s education platforms (EKB, MoETE LMS) operate as national systems; no explicit open interoperability standards are published.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Integration via API or content partnership with EKB is the main route for national-scale deployment.  
- No public mandate for IMS Global or SCORM compliance, but alignment aids compatibility.  
- Data exchange with government platforms requires MoETE approval.

## 10. Cybersecurity & Child Online Safety

**Key country insight:**  
Egypt’s *Cybercrime Law No. 175/2018* and *Child Law No. 12/1996 (amended 2008)* establish legal obligations for online safety, data protection, and content moderation.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Providers must ensure secure hosting and user authentication.  
- Harmful or inappropriate content is prohibited and subject to inspection.  
- Platforms serving minors should include parental controls and reporting mechanisms.  

**Sources:**  
- [Cybercrime Law No. 175/2018 (Arabic)](https://manshurat.org/node/47117)  
- [National Council for Childhood and Motherhood (NCCM)](https://nccm.gov.eg/)

## 11. Delivery Constraints & Design Preferences

**Key country insight:**  
Urban–rural disparities in connectivity and device access persist. While secondary schools are largely connected, many primary and technical institutions lack stable broadband or tablets.  

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Offline and low-bandwidth functionality is critical.  
- Mobile-first design is preferable given high smartphone penetration.  
- Content must be lightweight and localised for Arabic-speaking learners.

## 12. Notes & Gaps

- **Clear requirements:** Data protection (Law 151/2020), cybersecurity (Law 175/2018), curriculum alignment (MoETE).  
- **Emerging expectations:** Interoperability with EKB, digital assessment alignment, teacher PD integration.  
- **Gaps:** No public interoperability standard; limited clarity on EdTech certification or procurement frameworks.  
- **Practical implications:**  
  - Vendors must budget for curriculum mapping and Arabic localisation.  
  - Partnerships with MoETE/EKB are essential for scale.  
  - Offline capability remains a competitive advantage.  
  - Data documentation and local registration are required for compliance.
