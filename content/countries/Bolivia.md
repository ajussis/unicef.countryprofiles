# Bolivia — EdTech Suitability & Compliance Profile  
A structured, source-based overview to assess how well EdTech tools align with Bolivia’s education system, regulatory environment, digital policies, and real-world delivery conditions.

---

## 1. Education System Overview (Context Setting)

**Overview:**  
Bolivia’s education system is administered centrally by the [Ministry of Education (Ministerio de Educación)](https://www.minedu.gob.bo/), which oversees policy, curriculum, and teacher training. The system follows the structure established by the **“Ley de Educación Avelino Siñani-Elizardo Pérez” (Law No. 070, 2010)**, which emphasizes intercultural, plurinational, and community-based education. It comprises initial (preschool), primary, secondary (diversified), and higher education levels. Education is compulsory from age 6 to 17.

## 2. EdTech Implementation Landscape (Current State)

**Overview:**  
Bolivia’s EdTech landscape remains uneven. The Ministry of Education operates limited national virtual education platforms, such as *Educa Bolivia*, primarily developed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Connectivity gaps remain significant: according to the [World Bank Digital Economy Assessment (2022)](https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/), rural and indigenous areas face low internet penetration and limited access to devices. Donor-supported initiatives (UNICEF, UNESCO, CAF) have promoted digital literacy and radio-based learning in underserved regions. Most deployment remains pilot-based and fragmented rather than fully integrated into the national system.

## 3. Core Pedagogy

**Key country insight:**  
Bolivia’s pedagogy is guided by the **Avelino Siñani–Elizardo Pérez Law (2010)**, emphasizing community-based, productive, and intercultural education that integrates local knowledge with national standards.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- EdTech content must align with **“educación socio-comunitaria productiva”** principles.  
- Tools should allow integration of indigenous languages and community contexts.  
- Approval for classroom use may require Ministry validation or curricular linkage evidence.  
- Teacher autonomy is limited by centralized curricular frameworks.

**Requirement basis:** Law No. 070 (2010)

## 4. Focus Skills

**Key country insight:**  
The national education policy prioritizes **foundational literacy and numeracy**, **technical and vocational education**, and **productive community skills**. Recent policy also emphasizes **digital competence development** for teachers and students.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Literacy, numeracy, and life skills solutions are desirable.  
- Tools supporting **digital literacy** and **STEM** are increasingly encouraged.  
- Non-aligned “soft skills” solutions may face limited curricular uptake.

## 5. Content & Curriculum Alignment

**Key country insight:**  
Curriculum design is centralized under the Ministry of Education, following the **Base Curricular del Sistema Educativo Plurinacional (SCBEP)**. Instruction is multilingual (Spanish, Quechua, Aymara, and other indigenous languages).

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- EdTech content must align explicitly with **SCBEP learning outcomes**.  
- Localisation in **Spanish and at least one indigenous language** is expected for public-sector use.  
- Foreign content requires adaptation to the **plurinational and intercultural** pedagogical model.  
- Ministry approval or pilot authorisation is often required before scaling.

---

## 6. Teacher Professional Development

**Key country insight:**  
Teacher training is state-controlled and delivered via **Escuelas Superiores de Formación de Maestros (ESFM)**. Continuous professional development (CPD) is mandatory and managed through Ministry-approved programmes.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- EdTech teacher training modules must align with Ministry CPD frameworks.  
- Partnerships with ESFM or departmental education offices are recommended for scale.  
- Certificates or micro-credentials may require Ministry validation to count as formal CPD.

## 7. Assessment Approach

**Key country insight:**  
National assessments are centrally administered and focus on learning outcomes aligned with the SCBEP. Formative assessment is encouraged but not systematically implemented nationwide.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Digital tools must align with **national learning standards** and support reporting consistent with Ministry formats.  
- Alternative assessments (competency-based, adaptive) can be piloted but require Ministry approval.  
- Integration with the national education information system (SIE) may become a requirement.

## 8. Data Governance & Privacy

**Key country insight:**  
Bolivia lacks a comprehensive data protection law equivalent to GDPR. However, the **Constitution (Art. 130)** and **Law No. 164 on Telecommunications and ICT (2011)** establish basic principles on data privacy and confidentiality. There is no dedicated data protection authority.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- No explicit data localisation mandate, but sensitive personal data must be handled with consent.  
- Providers should adopt **voluntary GDPR-aligned standards** to ensure trust and donor compliance.  
- Child data protection must follow general privacy principles; no specific children’s data law exists.  
- Cross-border data transfer is not explicitly regulated but should be disclosed transparently.

**Sources:**  
- [Ley No. 164 de Telecomunicaciones, Tecnologías de Información y Comunicación (2011)](https://www.lexivox.org/norms/BO-L-164.xhtml)  
- [Constitución Política del Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia (2009)](https://www.oas.org/juridico/pdfs/mesicic4_bol_const.pdf)  

---

## 9. Technical Interoperability

**Key country insight:**  
There is no formal national interoperability framework for EdTech or education data. The **Sistema de Información Educativa (SIE)** collects school-level data, but integration standards are unpublished.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Expect limited API or data exchange standards.  
- Use open standards (LTI, SCORM, xAPI) for compatibility with future systems.  
- Integration with *Educa Bolivia* or SIE may require bilateral technical agreements.  
- Cloud-based tools should ensure local data mirroring if requested.

**Sources:**  
- [Ministerio de Educación — SIE Overview](https://www.minedu.gob.bo/)  
- [World Bank — Bolivia Digital Economy Assessment (2022)](https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/)

## 10. Cybersecurity & Child Online Safety

**Key country insight:**  
Bolivia’s **Cybercrime Law No. 164 (2011)** and **Supreme Decree No. 1793 (2013)** cover cybersecurity and ICT regulation but do not include detailed child online protection measures. UNICEF and ITU have supported awareness campaigns under the **Child Online Protection (COP) Initiative**.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Implement strong authentication and content moderation controls.  
- Child-friendly privacy notices and parental consent features are expected under international best practice.  
- No formal national certification, but adherence to **ITU COP Guidelines** is advisable for credibility.

## 11. Delivery Constraints & Design Preferences

**Key country insight:**  
Digital inequality is high: as of 2023, only around **55% of households** have internet access, and rural connectivity remains under 30% (World Bank). Device availability and electricity reliability vary widely.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Offline or low-bandwidth modes are essential.  
- Mobile-first design is preferable to PC-based deployment.  
- Local caching and SMS/USSD support can increase reach.  
- Language localisation (Spanish + indigenous) is critical for adoption.  

**Sources:**

- [ITU — ICT Indicators for Bolivia (2023)](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/stat/default.aspx)

## 12. Notes & Gaps

- **Strict requirement:** Curriculum alignment with *Base Curricular del SEP* (Law No. 070).  
- **Emerging expectation:** Digital skills and STEM education inclusion.  
- **Gap:** No comprehensive personal data protection or EdTech certification law.  
- **Gap:** No formal interoperability framework or digital ID integration for education.  
- **Practical implication:** Vendors must invest in localisation (language, context) and offline functionality.  
- **Implementation challenge:** Rural infrastructure limits synchronous or high-bandwidth tools.
