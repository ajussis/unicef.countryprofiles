# Guinea — EdTech Suitability & Compliance Profile  
A structured, source-based overview to assess how well EdTech tools align with Guinea’s education system, regulatory environment, digital policies, and real-world delivery conditions.

---

## 1. Education System Overview (Context Setting)

Guinea’s education system is centrally governed by the **Ministry of Pre-University Education and Literacy (MEPU-A)**, the **Ministry of Technical Education and Vocational Training (METFP)**, and the **Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MESRS)**. The system follows a **6-4-3 structure**: six years of primary, four of lower secondary, and three of upper secondary education. Reforms since the 2010s have aimed at universalizing basic education and improving teacher quality, but access and quality remain uneven, especially in rural areas.

## 2. EdTech Implementation Landscape (Current State)

EdTech adoption in Guinea is **nascent and fragmented**, largely driven by donor-supported initiatives. The **World Bank’s “Digital Guinea” project (2020–2025)** and the **UNICEF-supported Giga initiative** are expanding school connectivity and digital literacy. A limited number of schools in Conakry and urban areas use ICT tools, while rural schools rely on radio and offline digital content. There is no centralized national learning platform yet, though the **Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Digital Economy (MPTEN)** promotes digital inclusion through the *National Digital Strategy 2019–2024*.

## 3. Core Pedagogy

**Key insight:**  
Guinea’s national curriculum is **teacher- and textbook-centered**, with strong alignment to national examinations. Curriculum reforms emphasize competency-based approaches, but implementation remains limited outside pilot programs.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- EdTech tools must align closely with **state-approved curricula and exam content**.  
- Limited autonomy for teachers means **customizable or adaptive learning tools need official validation**.  
- Demonstrating consistency with **national learning objectives** is essential for acceptance.  
- Offline or blended models should mirror classroom pedagogy rather than replace it.

---

## 4. Focus Skills

**Key insight:**  
National priorities emphasize **foundational literacy and numeracy**, **digital literacy**, and **technical and vocational skills** to support employability and youth entrepreneurship.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Tools supporting **basic education recovery** (literacy/numeracy) are most aligned with policy priorities.  
- Solutions promoting **digital skills and TVET** integration are encouraged.  
- Less emphasis on advanced STEM or global citizenship content unless donor-supported.

## 5. Content & Curriculum Alignment

**Key insight:**  
Curriculum content is standardized and approved by MEPU-A. Instruction is in **French**, with some bilingual initiatives using national languages at early grades.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- **Curriculum mapping against MEPU-A standards** is required for public school use.  
- Content must be in **French** or provide approved translations.  
- Foreign content must be **localized and validated** by national curriculum authorities.  
- Integration of national cultural context improves acceptance.

## 6. Teacher Professional Development

**Key insight:**  
Guinea faces acute teacher shortages and uneven training. The **National Teacher Training Plan (PNF)** promotes in-service professional development, with limited digital integration.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- EdTech should include **embedded teacher training modules** or integrate with existing PNF frameworks.  
- **Cascade training models** (trainer-of-trainers) are preferred for scalability.  
- Certification by MEPU-A or regional education directorates is needed for formal recognition.  

**Sources:**

---

## 7. Assessment Approach

**Key insight:**  
Assessment remains **exam-driven**, with national exams at the end of primary, lower, and upper secondary levels. Formative assessment practices are limited.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Tools must support **summative exam preparation** or align with official testing standards.  
- Formative or adaptive assessment tools require **demonstrated alignment** with national benchmarks.  
- No evidence of policy recognition for automated or AI-based assessment systems.

## 8. Data Governance & Privacy

**Key insight:**  
Guinea has **no comprehensive data protection law** as of 2024, though a **Personal Data Protection Bill** has been drafted under the **Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Digital Economy (MPTEN)**. The **Autorité de Protection des Données Personnelles (APDP)** is not yet operational.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- No explicit national data localization requirements, but **good-practice compliance with GDPR-like principles** is advisable.  
- Explicit **parental consent for children’s data** should be obtained.  
- EdTech providers should **host data on secure, reputable servers** and disclose storage locations transparently.  

**Sources:**  
- [MPTEN – Draft Data Protection Law (2022)](https://mpten.gov.gn/)  
- No operational APDP website as of 2024.

---

## 9. Technical Interoperability

**Key insight:**  
There are no official **interoperability or technical standards** for education systems. Guinea’s EMIS is donor-supported (UNESCO and UNICEF), operating independently of any LMS standard.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Expect **no mandated interoperability frameworks**.  
- Solutions should support **open standards (e.g., SCORM, LTI)** for future integration.  
- APIs or data export features may be required for project-level EMIS integration.

## 10. Cybersecurity & Child Online Safety

**Key insight:**  
Guinea adopted a **Cybersecurity and Cybercrime Law (2016)** that criminalizes online abuse but lacks detailed child online protection measures. The **National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI-Guinée)** oversees implementation.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Providers must **ensure appropriate digital safeguards** (password protection, secure logins).  
- **Child-friendly content moderation** and data anonymization are recommended.  
- No mandatory certification, but **alignment with ANSSI-Guinée guidelines** demonstrates compliance.

## 11. Delivery Constraints & Design Preferences

**Key insight:**  
Severe disparities in **electricity access (≈44%)** and **internet penetration (≈33%)** constrain digital learning. Rural schools often rely on **offline or radio-based solutions**.

**What this means for EdTech deployment:**  
- Design for **offline functionality or low-bandwidth operation**.  
- Support **mobile-first** access (smartphones > PCs).  
- Incorporate **local language interfaces** where possible.  
- Plan for **hybrid distribution** (USB, SD cards, printed materials).

## 12. Notes & Gaps

- **Clear requirements:** Curriculum alignment, cybersecurity law compliance.  
- **Emerging expectations:** Data privacy standards pending legislation; digital skills integration in education policy.  
- **Gaps:** No operational data protection authority; no national EdTech accreditation framework.  
- **Practical implications:**  
  - EdTech vendors must self-regulate privacy and security.  
  - Offline and French-language content critical for scale.  
  - Curriculum mapping to MEPU-A standards likely requires in-country expert support.  
  - Teacher capacity building remains a key success factor.
